Kunt'aarsh Ritual Book

# **Identify**

***1st Level Divination***
**Casting Time** 1 minute
**Range** Touch
**Components** VSM (A Pearl worth at least 100 gp and an Owl Feather)
**Duration** Instantaneous

### Effect
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

# **Illusory Script**

***1st Level Illusion***
**Casting Time** 1 minute
**Range** Touch
**Components** SM (A lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
**Duration** 10 Days

### Effect
You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language, though the language must be one you know.

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.
